# COST
 CubeSat forms a cost-effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit.
 After delays from low-cost launchers such as Interorbital Systems,launch prices have been about $100,000 per unit, 
 but newer operators are offering lower pricing.Some CubeSats have complicated components or instruments,
 such as LightSail-1, that pushes their construction cost into the millions,but a basic 1U CubeSat can cost
 about $50,000 to construct so CubeSats are a viable option for some schools and universities; 
 as well as small businesses to develop CubeSats for commercial purposes.
