CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that utilization a standard size and shape factor. The standard CubeSat estimate utilizes a "one unit" or "1U" measuring 10x10x10 cms and is extendable to bigger sizes; 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and even 12U. Initially created in 1999 by California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) and Stanford University to give a stage to training and space investigation. The improvement of CubeSats has progressed into it's own particular industry with government, industry and the scholarly world working together for regularly expanding capacities. CubeSats now give a financially savvy stage to science examinations, new innovation exhibits and propelled mission ideas utilizing groups of stars, swarms disaggregated framework.
