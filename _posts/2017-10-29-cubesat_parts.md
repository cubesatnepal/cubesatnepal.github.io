## What we will be able to do?
We will receive signals from the orbiting cubesat in our ground station and the satellite will demonstrate communication capabilities.

We will be able to control altitude and orientation of cubesat.

We will be able to take pictures, send it back to our ground station and start mapping using the on-board camera.
