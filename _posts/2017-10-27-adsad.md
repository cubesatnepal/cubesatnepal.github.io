# Electrically powered propulsion

Elecrically powered propulsion is a system of spacecraft propulsion widely used nowadays. An electrically-powered spacecraft propulsion system uses electrical energy to change the velocity of a spacecraft. Most of these kinds of spacecraft propulsion systems work by electrically expelling propellant (reaction mass) at high speed, but electrodynamics work by interacting with a planet's magnetic field.

Since they have higher exhaust speed, electric thrusters use less propellant than the chemical thrusters. However, the thrust is much weaker compared to chemical rockets due to limited electric power, but electric propulsion can provide a small thrust for a long time. Electric propulsion can achieve high speeds over long periods and thus can work better than chemical rockets for some deep space missions. An electro-rocket with an external power source (transmissible through laser on the solar panels) has a theoretical possibility for interstellar flight. However, electric propulsion is not a method suitable for launches from the Earth's surface, as the thrust for such systems is too weak.
