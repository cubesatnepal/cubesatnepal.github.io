# Cubesat Launch and Cost

1. A 1U cubesat of 1.4 kg will cost from 40,000 to 100,000 USD.
2. Our only option is NASA's Cubesat Launch Initiative [https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative/]- Lowest cost possible at around $4000/kg.
3. Launching will be another project and has to be booked 2-3 years in advance.
4. Payment timeline: 10% for reservation, 30% before 2 years, 20% before 19 months, 20% before 13 months, 15% before 7 months and 5% before lunch.
5. Cubesat launches are usually piggy backs of main satellite and hence getting a specific orbit might be difficult.
