# QB50
QB50 is a proposed international network of 50 CubeSats for multi-point, in-situ measurements in the lower thermosphere (90–350 km) and re-entry research.
QB50 is an initiative of the Von Karman Institute and is funded by the European Commission as part of the 7th Framework Programme (FP7). 
Double-unit (2U) CubeSats (10×10×20 cm) are developed, with one unit (the 'functional' unit) providing the usual satellite functions
and the other unit (the 'science' unit) accommodating a set of standardised sensors for lower thermosphere and re-entry research.
35 CubeSats are envisaged to be provided by universities from 22 countries around the world, among them 4 are from the US,
4 from China, 4 from France, 3 from Australia and 3 South Korea.Ten 2U or 3U CubeSats are foreseen to serve for in-orbit
technology demonstration of new space technologies.The Request for Proposals (RFP) for the QB50 CubeSat was released on February 15, 2012.
Two "precursor" QB50 satellites were launched aboard a Dnepr rocket on June 19, 2014.[86] All 50 CubeSats were supposed to be launched together
on a single Cyclone-4 launch vehicle in February 2016,but due to the unavailability of the launch vehicle, 40 satellites are now planned
to be launched aboard Cygnus CRS OA-7 in April 2017 and subsequently deployed from the ISS.[88] A dozen other cubesats have been manifested on
the PSLV-XL C38 mission in May 2017.
