# System Integration and Testing

1. Each subsystem interacts with every other subsystem in cubesat as it is an integrated engineering system where systems engineering approach is required.
2. All the subsystem interactions have to be identified and has to be integrated appropriately.
3. For testing: Vibration Testing(to test launch loads), Thermovac Testing(to test thermal loads) and also uplink and downlink communication testing has to be done.
