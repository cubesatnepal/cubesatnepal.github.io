The CubeSat dispatch idea chose licenses the dispatch of different auxiliary payloads which might be stacked into a launcher tube, called P-POD (Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer), created by CalPoly. P-POD is a standard arrangement framework that guarantees all CubeSat designers fit in with regular physical necessities. The P-POD assumes a basic part as the interface between the dispatch vehicle and CubeSats. It uses a tubular outline and can hold up to 34 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm of deployable equipment space. 

The P-POD limits potential communications with the essential payload(s) on a dispatch vehicle by physically encasing the CubeSats and requiring that they be propelled in a lethargic "off" state.
