Thermal Subsystem

1. Cubesats get heat from 150 - 200 degree Celcius while sunlit phase and while dark, the temperatures will drop to -150 degree Celcius.
2. Electronic component of the cubesat will also generate heat load.
3. Most of the electronic components only operate between -20 to +60 degree Celcius.
4. While the cubesat will be in outer space, it will only be able to dissipate heat through radiation heat transfer.
5. Components placement should be done appropriately so that heat load is spread throughout the spacecraft and does not go beyong the operating temperature boundaries.
6. Heat sinks have to be designed if necessary be.
