# Cubesat Overview 
Started in 1999, the CubeSat Project began as a collaborative effort between Prof. Jordi PuigSuari
at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), San Luis Obispo, and Prof. Bob
Twiggs at Stanford University's Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL). The purpose of
the project is to provide a standard for design of picosatellites to reduce cost and development
time, increase accessibility to space, and sustain frequent launches. Presently, the CubeSat Project
is an international collaboration of over 100 universities, high schools, and private firms
developing picosatellites containing scientific, private, and government payloads. A CubeSat is a
10 cm cube with a mass of up to 1.33 kg. Developers benefit from the sharing of information
within the community. If you are planning to start a CubeSat project, please contact Cal Poly.

# Purpose 
The primary mission of the CubeSat Program is to provide access to space for small payloads.
The primary responsibility of Cal Poly, as the developer of the Poly Picosatellite Orbital
Deployer (P-POD), is to ensure the safety of the CubeSat and protect the launch vehicle (LV),
primary payload, and other CubeSats. CubeSat developers should play an active role in ensuring
the safety and success of CubeSat missions by implementing good engineering practice, testing,
and verification of their systems. Failures of CubeSats, the P-POD, or interface hardware can
damage the LV or a primary payload and put the entire CubeSat Program in jeopardy. As part of
the CubeSat Community, all participants have an obligation to ensure safe operation of their
systems and to meet the design and minimum testing requirements outlined in this document.
Requirements in this document may be superseded by launch provider requirements.
