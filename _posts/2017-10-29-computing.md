Like bigger satellites, CubeSats regularly highlight numerous PCs dealing with various assignments in parallel including the mentality control, control administration, payload operation, and essential control errands. Beds state of mind control frameworks ordinarily incorporate their own particular PC, as do the power administration frameworks. Payloads must have the capacity to interface with the essential PC to be valuable, which now and then requires the utilization of another little PC. This might be because of impediments in the essential PC's capacity to control the payload with constrained correspondence conventions, to counteract over-burdening the essential PC with crude information taking care of, or to guarantee payload's operation proceeds continuous by the shuttle's other registering needs, for example, correspondence. All things considered, the essential PC might be utilized for payload related undertakings, which may incorporate picture handling, information investigation, and information pressure. Assignments which the essential PC ordinarily handles incorporate the appointment of undertakings to alternate PCs, mentality control, estimations for orbital moves, booking, and enactment of dynamic warm control parts. CubeSat PCs are profoundly vulnerable to radiation and developers will find a way to guarantee appropriate operation in the high radiation of room, for example, the utilization of the ECC RAM. A few satellites may join repetition by actualizing different essential PCs, this should be possible on significant missions to diminish the danger of mission disappointment. Buyer cell phones have been utilized for figuring in some CubeSats, for example, NASA's PhoneSats
